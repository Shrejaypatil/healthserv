HealthServ is an AI-powered web application that leverages machine learning to predict various health conditions including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, kidney disease, liver disease, and Parkinson’s. The platform is built using Flask and integrates several pre-trained machine learning models to provide quick and reliable health assessments.

## 📝 Features
- **Disease Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of multiple health conditions using advanced ML models.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clean and intuitive UI for easy navigation.
- **Secure Login**: User authentication with secure login and registration system.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully responsive interface accessible across devices.
